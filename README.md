On my homepage there are many links that all currently take you to the find events page.

And in the top right you can log in or sign up if you aren't logged in.  Once logged in you can navigate to the find events page, find groups page, create group page, or logout.

Once on the find page you can toggle between searching for events and groups and see information relevant information for them.

After selecting one you get to see the full information for the group/event.  Events have links back to their associated groups, and the group organizer has the ability to edit the group, delete the group, create an event, or delete the event.

To launch locally run npm instsall in the Frontend and Backend folders, then do "npm run" in both folders and the app should launch automatically.  If not you can access it at 'localhost:3000'.
